# Data Structures And Algorithms
This repository contains the projects and related materials for the CMPE 250 Data Structures And Algorithms course with Java.

## **Project 1: Management of The Hierarchical Structure**
The goal of this project is to maintain and analyze the hierarchical structure of the Tattaglia Crime Family. The family is organized based on the Golden Mean Score (GMS), 
which dictates their rank within the hierarchy. The structure is dynamic, with members joining and leaving, which requires continuous updates and reorganization to maintain the balance.
### Key Features:
    Hierarchical Structure Management: Maintain a dynamic hierarchical structure where members are organized based on their GMS.
    Member Management: Add new members, remove existing members, and reorganize the hierarchy as necessary.
    Family Analysis: Perform various analyses such as identifying the lowest common superior of two members, determining the maximum number of independent members, and listing members of the same rank.
## **Project 2: Management of The Company**
The goal of this project is to build an efficient system to manage hiring, firing, promotions, and bonuses for employees across multiple branches in different cities.
The system should handle frequent updates and ensure smooth operations while maintaining a clear hierarchical structure among employees.
### Key Features:
    Employee Management: Handle the hiring, firing, and promotion of employees across different branches.
    Monthly Score Updates: Process monthly performance scores to calculate bonuses and promotion points.
    Promotion System: Implement a hierarchical promotion system based on accumulated promotion points.
    Dismissal and Leaving: Manage employee dismissals based on performance, and handle voluntary leaves while ensuring branch operations.
    Branch Management: Track and manage employee roles within each branch across multiple cities.
    Bonus Reporting: Generate monthly and overall bonus reports for each branch.
## **Project 3: Collaborative Playlist Management System **
The goal of this project is to build an efficient system to manage playlists, track changes, and create a collaborative playlist, EpicBlend, based on predefined rules and constraints.
The system should handle additions, removals, and queries efficiently, ensuring the playlist maintains a consistent vibe throughout the trip.
### Key Features:
    Playlist Management: Handle the addition and removal of songs from multiple playlists.
    Category-Based Playlist Creation: Create a collaborative playlist, EpicBlend, based on song categories (Heartache, Roadtrip, Blissful) with specific limits.
    Dynamic Updates: Efficiently update EpicBlend when changes occur in any of the playlists.
    Query Handling: Provide the current state of EpicBlend upon request, sorted by play count and song name.
